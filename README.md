### Simple single patch app that queries the PokeAPI, and allows two players to select from 100 different Pokémon. 


Features to implement:
- Needs to have an image of pokémon along with stats
- Add in some margin/padding to shape up layout
- Look into implementing a wrapper to help with caching; possibly [pokeapi-js-wrapper](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi-js-wrapper#install) others available [here](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi)

Site uses some of the following: 
- [Bootstrap 4.5.2](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [NES.css](https://nostalgic-css.github.io/NES.css/)
- [Google font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P?selection.family=Press+Start+2P&sidebar.open=true)
