### Simple single page app that queries the PokeAPI, and allows two players to select from 30 different PokÃ©mon. 

This is meant to be a learning project for working with APIs and displaying content

Features to implement:
- Pull down images of PokÃ©mon sprites and display on the page âœ…
- Pull down and display stats of selected PokÃ©mon âœ…
- Add in some margin/padding to shape up layout âœ…
- Need to refactor script a bit, make it a little more modular ðŸ”œ

Site uses some of the following: 
- [Bootstrap 4.5.2](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [NES.css](https://nostalgic-css.github.io/NES.css/)
- [Google font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P?selection.family=Press+Start+2P&sidebar.open=true)
